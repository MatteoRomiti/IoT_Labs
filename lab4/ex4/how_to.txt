client 1:
run sub_all.py on the Raspberry Pi to see the temperature and the humidity info published by pub12.py (run it there as well)
run pub3.py to send the command for changing the status of the relay (sub_all.py will execute this command) and sub4.py (on the Raspberry Pi) to see when it changes

client 2:
run client2sub.py on the Raspberry Pi to see: Temperature, Humidity and Relay Status published from client2pub.py (run it on the Raspberry Pi with sudo privileges);
to change the relay status: open a python terminal with sudo privileges and run this:
...
>>> import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
>>> GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
>>> GPIO.setup(22, GPIO.OUT)
>>> GPIO.output(22, 0)
>>> GPIO.output(22, 1)
...

client 3:
this task is already implemented with pub3.py
